# HW for 11-775: Large-scale Multimedia Analysis

- HW1: In this homework, you are required to train and test a Multimedia Event Detection (MED). More speciﬁcally, your MED will be able to detect three diﬀerent events: assembling a shelter, batting in a run and making a cake. You will build two diﬀerent MED. The ﬁrst one will use Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coeﬃcients (MFCC) and the second one will use Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR) transcriptions.

- HW2: In this homework, you are required to train and test a Video-based Multimedia Event Detection (MED). As before, your MED will be able to detect the three events: assembling a shelter, batting in a run and making a cake. As the previous homework, you will build three different binary classifiers. The first one will use Improved Trajectory Features (Imtraj), the second one Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and the last one will use features extracted from a Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
